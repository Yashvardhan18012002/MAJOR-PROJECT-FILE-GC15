                            financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is
                            the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock
                            market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs
                            different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The paper focuses on the use of
                            Regression and LSTM based Machine learning to predict stock values. Factors considered are
                            open, close, low, high and volume.The stock market is one of the most unpredictable and
                            highly concerned places in the world. There is no fundamental way to forecast stock market
                            share prices. So people think stock market prediction is a gamble. Nevertheless, it is
                            possible to generate a constructive pattern by using different types of algorithms and
                            predict the share price. But when the characteristics are complex, and the largest portion
                            of these classification methods are linear, resulting bad performance in class label
                            prediction. In this paper we suggest a non-linear technique based on the Long Short-Term
                            Memory (LSTM) architecture. According to studies LSTM-based models predict time and
                            sequential models better than other models and RNN is the first algorithm with an internal
                            memory that remembers its input, making it perfect for sequential data machine learning
                            issues. For our experiment we collected the share market data from a particular company
                            named Beximco for the last 11 years. To reassert the effectiveness of the system different
                            test data are used. This work introduces a robust method that can predict stock price
                            accurately based on LSTM.-In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the
                            future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent
                            trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of
                            machine learning which makes predictions based on the values
                            of current stock market indices by training on their previous

                            high and volume. Stock market prediction seems a complex problem
                            because there are many factors that have yet to be addressed
                            and it doesnâ€™t seem statistical at first. But by proper use of
                            machine learning techniques, one can relate previous data to
                            the current data and train the machine to learn from it and
                            make appropriate assumptions.
                            The dataset being utilized for analysis was picked up
                            from Yahoo Finance. The dataset consisted of
                            approximately 9 lakh records of the required stock prices
                            and other relevant values. The data reflected the stock prices
                            at certain time intervals for each day of the year. It consisted
                            of various sections namely date, symbol, open, close, low,
                            high and volume. For the purpose of simulation and
                            analysis, the data for only one company was considered. All
                            the data was available in a file of csv format which was first
                            read and transformed into a data-frame using the
                            Pandaslibrary in Python. From this, the data for one
                            particular company was extracted by segregating data on the
                            basis of the symbol field. Following this normalization of
                            the data was performed through usage of the sklearn library
                            in Python and the data was divided into training and testing
                            sets. The test set was kept as 20% of the available dataset.
                            Although machine learning as such has many models but
                            this paper focuses on two of the most important amongst
                            them and made the predictions using these.</h6>
